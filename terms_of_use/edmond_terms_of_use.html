	<p>
	Edmond Repository is a service for the publication of research data. It is provided by Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL) on behalf of Max Planck Society. Therefore the <a href="https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/services/tos.html" target="_blank">Terms of Service of the Max Planck Digital Library</a> are valid for Edmond. <br/>
	Edmond’s aim is to provide a platform for granting access to valuable research data and to promote the accessibility of these data. It may be used by uploading content to Edmond Repository (submitter) and by downloading (and using) content from Edmond Repository (downloader).
	</p>

<h2 class="imj_sectionHeadline">Content</h2>
	
	<p>
	Edmond is a repository for research data, which is data that is created during scientific research in all fields of scholarship. Also negative results and other data that does not lead to a publication are welcome. All other sorts of data are not allowed to be uploaded in Edmond. In case it is not clear for you whether your data is research data or not, please contact the <a href="mailto:edmond@mpdl.mpg.de" target="_blank">Edmond support</a> before depositing the data. <br/>
	MPDL services do not prescreen any content and are not obliged to do so, but we reserve the right to review content and may delete or remove content without notice from the platform in case it is considered inappropriate in its sole discretion, it is not related to scientific research or violates the <a href="https://www.mpg.de/229457/Regeln_guter_wiss_Praxis__Volltext-Dokument_.pdf" target="_blank">Rules of Good Scientific Practice (Regeln zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft)</a>.
	</p>	

<h2 class="imj_sectionHeadline">Registration</h2>

	<p>
	The Edmond Service is free of charge for all employees of the Max Planck Society and its scientific project partners with a maximum of 1GB of storage for data from research projects. If you are planning to extend this quota please contact the <a href="mailto:edmond@mpdl.mpg.de" target="_blank">Edmond support</a>. It is not allowed to exploit this service for data other than those arising from research projects associated with the Max Planck Society. 
	</p>

<h2 class="imj_sectionHeadline">Scope of Access</h2>

	<p>
	The aim of putting content into Edmond is to publish it. But it is submitter’s choice to publish the content immediately or make it in a first step only available to specific users including authors/right-holders and explicitly named users like publishers. These users can at a minimum view and download the data. <br/> 
	Content, once published, will be kept and made available for at least 10 years. Once published, submitter has no possibility to erase the content but may withdraw it which means content will not be visible on the Edmond interface any more, but is still retrievable via its original link and/or DOI (together with a comment from the submitter why this content is withdrawn). <br/>
	On publish, depositors grant Edmond Repository a non-exclusive right to use content deposited in the repository, in particular the right to make content publicly accessible on a permanent basis – also for downloading.
	</p>

<h2 class="imj_sectionHeadline">License</h2>

	During the publishing process within Edmond, there is the possibility to assign a license to the data. A list of suitable licenses can be found in the <a href="http://edmond.mpdl.mpg.de/imeji/#tabsEN-2" target="_blank">FAQs</a>. <br>
	If no license is assigned, the data will be released under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY 4.0</a>. By uploading Content to Edmond Repository submitter agrees to and grants third parties the right to use the content on the basis of this license.
