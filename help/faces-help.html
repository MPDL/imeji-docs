FACES is freely available for usage in scientific research.
</p>
<p>
Without a user account, only the pictures of six exemplary faces (72 pictures) can be viewed. Full access to this online service and all its objects is possible after <a href="register" target="_blank">registration</a> and <a href="login" target="_blank">log in</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Researchers can apply for an account on a case-by-case (i.e., person-by-person and study-by-study) basis.
</p>
<p>
After registration, you will receive an e-mail with a confirmation link. Click on the link in order to confirm your registration. Please note: Even with your registration confirmed, you will not get immediate access to the FACES platform. Access will only be granted upon receipt of a valid application form. This may take a few days.

<h2 class="imj_sectionHeadline" style="padding:0"><a id="collections"></a>Collections</h2>

<p>
All available collections are listed under COLLECTIONS. You have to be logged in to see all collections. If  not logged in, only publicly available FACES photographs are displayed. The publicly released collection is marked with a globe icon, all other collections with a group icon on the right side of the page.
</p>

<p>
After selecting a collection, you may easily switch to another collection by clicking on the tab COLLECTIONS again and selecting the next collection you are interested in. As for the Dynamic FACES collection, higher resolution videos are available as a sub-collection with “High definition” as folder name.

<h2 class="imj_sectionHeadline" style="padding:0"><a id="viewing_options"></a>Viewing options</h2>

<p>
The system offers three different ways to describe your items with metadata:
</p>

<h3 class="imj_sectionHeadline" style="padding:0"><a id="upload"></a>File Upload</h3>
<p>
You may switch between two viewing options, the thumbnail view and the list view, by clicking on the small gear-wheel icon. Here you can select the viewing option you prefer.
</p>
<p>
By default, all collections are displayed in the thumbnail view. As for videos, the thumbnail shows the emotion that is visible at the end of each video clip. Hovering the mouse arrow over a thumbnail will show the metadata of the corresponding object (e.g. emotion, age group, gender).
</p>
<p>
The list view allows you to sort the objects of each collection by different criteria (file name, file type, file size, date modified) in ascending or descending order. You may choose the sorting criterion by clicking on the respective column heading. The sorting order can be changed by clicking on the same heading again. The list view is particularly useful for quickly sorting the items list by file name. The file name always contains the number that was assigned to a face in the original FACES picture set.
</p>
<p>
Both in the thumbnail view and in the list view, you can change the number of objects displayed per page by using the pull-down menu at the bottom of each page. You may also navigate from page to page or to the beginning and to the end of each collection by using the corresponding navigation bar at the bottom of each page or by entering the desired page number directly in the box right from the navigation bar.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to view single items in more detail by either clicking on the corresponding thumbnail (in the thumbnail view) or on the corresponding file name (in the list view). Pictures can be zoomed or rotated by clicking on the corresponding icons. Video clips can be viewed by clicking on the play button. Please note that different resolutions offered for video files only refer to the thumbnail view of the corresponding video. The video clip itself can only be downloaded by clicking on the link “Original file”. As for the Dynamic FACES collection, higher resolution videos are available as a sub-collection with “High definition” as folder name.

<h2 class="imj_sectionHeadline" style="padding:0"><a id="faceted_navigation"></a>Faceted navigation</h2>

<p>
Faceted navigation allows you to navigate the list of available items (i.e. photographs or videos) by applying multiple filters using metadata values/attributes assigned to them (e.g. emotion, gender, etc.). Facets are displayed on the right-hand side of the displayed items. Please note that the facet “Picture set” is not available for the Dynamic FACES collection.
